The database is designed to organize and store data about individuals (people), their skills, roles assigned, and associated metadata. It encompasses tables for people, skills, roles, peopleskills, and peopleroles. The people table holds personal details, skills table contains various skills, roles table represents different roles, while peopleskills and peopleroles serve as junction tables linking people with their respective skills and roles. This database serves as a comprehensive repository to manage and analyze resume-related data for individuals in various roles and skillsets.\n",

The task of structuring tables, defining relationships, and executing SQL commands helped bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. It highlighted the importance of accurate data modeling, query optimization, and the significance of precise syntax. This experience fostered a stronger grasp of database management concepts and emphasized the need for meticulousness in database design and querying processes.\n"
